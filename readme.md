# Nyan Cat

## Achievements

I have 1 cat raining from top left to bottom right with background moving and music playing.

I haven't reached the "bonus" part of the exercise.

## Difficulties

I restarted the exercise from scratch because I got stuck and spent too much time trying to fix a function that was not working.

I was pretty slow about finding out about all the steps, knowing how to start, where to look at, etc... I would have appreciated an exercise divided into smaller steps with slightly more "guidance".

I'm very confused about how to write javascript because every website/user writes things in a different way. 


## Achievements

I tried to write as little javascript as possible, so I "cheated" a lot: 
* I used keyframes to move the cat and the background,
* I haven't read about setInterval yet but the page reloads after a 10s-timeOut anyway.

## Frustrations

I achieved more in 3 hours on Friday morning than on Wednesday and Thursday combined where I tried things that never worked...

Big breakdown at home on Wednesday night that really made me doubt about my ability to learn coding and follow the pace at BeCode. :-/ But switching tables on Thursday morning conforted me a lot because I realized I was not alone struggling. :-)
