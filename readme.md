# Nyan Cat

## Achievements

I have multiple cats raining from top left to bottom right with background moving and music playing.

I haven't completed all "bonus" instructions of the exercise.

## Difficulties

First try: I used keyframes to animate the cat but was block before the bonus part.
Second try: I used javascrip to animate the cat.

I haven't used a very short method, though. There's probably a simpler way to do it.

## Feedback about the exercise

I was pretty slow about finding out about all the steps, knowing how to start, where to look at, etc... I would have appreciated an exercise divided into smaller steps with slightly more "guidance".

I'm very confused about how to write javascript because every website/user writes things in a different way.
